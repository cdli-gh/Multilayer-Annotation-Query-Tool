# Multi-Layer Annotation Querying Tool 

## About the Project
This is a tool to integrate into a website that has the capacity to query through multiple layers of linguistic annotations like morphology, syntax and semantics annotations. 

- Would be able to search through the complete data when a word or the
annotations of the word or both are defined.
- Also, the system would be able to search for a combination of such word queries.
- The data is queried from RDF format which is flexible and will help integrate into a linked open data toolbox for computation. 
- Also, the tool will have a query language or a form which will be easy to use for non-technical people. 
- It will also highlight the results in the retrieved document which resulted in the retrieval of the document. 
- The tool will also return data in a format that allows for easy integration into any website.
